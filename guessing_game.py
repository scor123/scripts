"""
Write a program that asks a user whether they want to play
a game. If the user enters y or yes, indicate that youâ€™re
thinking of a number between 1 and 10 and ask the user to
guess the number. Your program should continue asking
the user to guess the number until they get it right. If they
get it right, print a congratulatory message and then ask if
they want to play again. This process should be repeated as
long as the user enters y or yes.
