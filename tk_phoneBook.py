"""
Write a program that stores names, phone numbers, and
emails of people in a phonebook. The window should have
three text boxes for the name, phone, and email. Then it
should have one button to add a contact, and one button to
show all contacts. Finally, it should have a label. When the
user clicks the Add button, the program reads the text
boxes and stores the information. When the user clicks the
Show button, it reads all the contacts stored and prints
them on a label.
